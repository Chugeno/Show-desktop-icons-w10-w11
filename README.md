# Windows Desktop Icon Manager

A simple but powerful batch script (`.bat`) to show or hide the main desktop icons in Windows. This is ideal for systems where customization options are restricted (e.g., due to Windows not being activated).

## Features

*   Easy-to-use interactive menu directly in the command prompt.
*   Individually toggle the visibility of the following desktop icons:
    *   This PC
    *   Recycle Bin
    *   User's Files
    *   Network
    *   Control Panel

## How to Use

1.  Download or clone this repository.
2.  Locate the `desktop-icons-manager.bat` file.
3.  Double-click the file to run it.
4.  A command prompt window with a menu will appear.
5.  Select the icon you want to configure by typing its number.
6.  Choose whether to Show (`S`) or Hide (`H`) the icon.
7.  The change will be applied and reflected on your desktop instantly.

## Compatibility

This script is designed to work on **Windows 10** and **Windows 11**.

> ### WARNING FOR WINDOWS 11 USERS
> 
> On **Windows 11**, the option to show or hide the **Control Panel** icon via this registry method no longer has any effect due to internal changes in the operating system. All other icon options work correctly on both versions of Windows.
